Assignment:

A telecom mission control SaaS platform provides intelligent services for enterprises. Multiple carriers often share cell towers, but not all towers support all carriers. The carriers (AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, etc.) determine the devices supported at the towers and the device's operating system (iOS, Android, Windows, etc.). For example, some towers will only allow iOS-based AT&T devices, while others will allow Android and Windows-based AT&T and T-Mobile devices, as well as additional unique combinations. The equipment at the cell tower detects the apps used by the user on their device and captures the actions performed on the app by the user. The system captures the policy determined by the enterprise to enforce the rule, allowing or denying the list of actions permitted on the app based on the user's role. The system provides value-added services such as a real-time dashboard to monitor the security health. A higher subscription plan provides auto-remedial action enforced at the cell towers through enterprise-defined policies to secure the edge. The system integrates with various communications real estate developers to ingest (register) the information related to the towers present nationwide and the carriers they serve. The system allows connecting to different sources for onboarding existing users and their devices. Additionally, the system enables auto-discovery of new enterprise devices through the cell towers.
